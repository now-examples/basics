# [Name] Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Name](site-link) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with [Name] on Now, you can use the [CLI Tool Used](CLI-link) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init charge
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the [Name] example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
