# Charge.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Charge.js](https://charge.js.org/) site using the [@now/static-build](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build) Builder.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Charge.js on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init charge
```

## Example Contents

The example consists of one source directory, `/source`, which contains an index and layout component. `/source` also includes a `/pages` directory where `.mdx` files are stored. This file structure is very basic as Charge focuses on simplicity, however, you are free to use whatever file structure suits your needs best.

The example also includes a `now.json` file, this is used to configure your build when deploying to Now. The `package.json` has seen some minor changes with the addition of scripts from the Charge.js [documentation](https://charge.js.org/usage) along with a `now-build` script used by Now in deployment.
