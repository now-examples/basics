# Docz Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Docz on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init docz
```

> The only change made is to add `dest: '/public'` to the `doczrc.js` file.

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Docz example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
