# Elm Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Elm](https://charge.js.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Elm on Now, you can use the [Elm CLI](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ create-elm-app my-app
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Elm example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
