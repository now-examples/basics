# Gatsby Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) app with serverless functions that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Gatsby on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init gatsby+functions
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Gatsby example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
