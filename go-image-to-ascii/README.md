Image to ASCII is powered by `@now/go`, and helps you generate an ASCII image from a picture.

## Deploy your own

Run the following command `now init go-image-to-ascii` to fetch the example to your local machine. (if you don't already have it, run `npm install -g now`)
 
Deploy by running `now` from the CLI.
