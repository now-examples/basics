# Hugo

[Live Demo](https://hugo-v2.now.sh)

In this example, we'll be deploying a static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website to Now using the [@now/static-build Builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/).

You can run the following command `now init hugo` to fetch the example to your local machine.

This example is based on the [Hugo Quick Start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and features the basic project scaffolding generated by using the `hugo new site <sitename>` command.
