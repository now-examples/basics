# Hugo Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Hugo on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init hugo
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Hugo example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
