# Jekyll Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

To get started with Jekyll on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init jekyll
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Jekyll example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
