# Next.js with an API

This example shows a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site  (located in `package.json`) powered by four APIs:

- [One written in Node.js](./api/node) (located in `api/node`)
- [One written in Go](./api/go) (located in `api/go`)
- [One written in Bash](./api/bash) (located in `api/bash`)
- [One written in Python](./api/python) (located in `api/python`)

In order to deploy, run:

When editing a file, you can run the following command to spawn a local development server:
