# Next.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Next.js on Now, you can use the [Create-Next-App CLI](https://open.segment.com/create-next-app/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ create-next-app my-app
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Next.js example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
