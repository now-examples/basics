# Apollo GraphQL server example

A simple example of a GraphQL server with Apollo Server.

## How to use

Simply run `now` to deploy, then you can access the GraphQL Playground at your deploy url.
This code is copied from the Apollo ['Getting Started'](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started.html) docs. You can run this example query:

```javascript
{
  books {
    title
    author
  }
}
```
