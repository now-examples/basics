# node-micro

A simple Node.js microservice that exposes a simple function.

To edit your function, refer to `./src/index.js`.

Optimized image that combines:

- `yarn` for installing dependencies
- `micro` as a lightweight HTTP server

for the highest build-time performance, smallest resulting artifact size
and fast bootup time.
