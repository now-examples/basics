# Polymer Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Polymer on Now, you can use the [Polymer CLI](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ polymer init
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Polymer example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
