# Polymer Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Polymer on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init polymer
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Polymer example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
