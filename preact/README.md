# Preact Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Preact on Now, you can use the [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ preact create default my-project
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Preact example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
