# @now/rust Example

This directory is a brief example of a serverless [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) function using the [@now/rust Builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/now-rust/).

The example consists of one Rust file, `index.rs`, that includes a `handler` function (required for a serverless Rust [lambda](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/)) that receives a request to the function and renders a response, stating the requested URL.
