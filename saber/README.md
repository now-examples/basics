# Saber Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Saber](https://saber.land) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Saber on Now, you can use [`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npm init site my-saber-site
```
