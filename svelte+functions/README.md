# Svelte Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app with serverless functions that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Initializing this Example

To get started with Svelte on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init svelte
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Svelte example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
